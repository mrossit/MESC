# ðŸ“‹ Deployment Checklist: Questionnaire Standardization

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### âœ… Code Quality

- [x] QuestionnaireService created (`server/services/questionnaireService.ts`)
- [x] All save endpoints updated (`server/routes/questionnaires.ts`)
- [x] Migration script created (`server/migrations/standardizeQuestionnaireResponses.ts`)
- [x] Unit tests passing (22/22 tests âœ…)
- [x] Real data verification (100% success rate âœ…)
- [x] No TypeScript errors in new code âœ…
- [x] Documentation complete âœ…

### âœ… Testing

```bash
# 1. Run unit tests
npm run test:run -- server/tests/questionnaireService.test.ts
# Expected: 22 tests passed

# 2. Test with real data
npx tsx server/tests/testMigration.ts
# Expected: 100% success rate

# 3. Dry-run migration
npx tsx server/migrations/testMigrationDryRun.ts
# Expected: All tests successful
```

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Code Changes

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on the correct branch
git status

# 2. Build the project
npm run build

# 3. Run type checks
npm run check

# 4. Deploy to production
# (Use your normal deployment process)
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment

```bash
# 1. Check that the service is available
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# 2. Verify new code is running
# (Check version/build number)
```

### Step 3: Run Migration (PRODUCTION)

```bash
# PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT
# Connect to production server

# 1. Verify database connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questionnaire_responses;"

# 2. Run migration
npx tsx server/migrations/standardizeQuestionnaireResponses.ts

# 3. Monitor output for errors
# Expected: All responses migrated successfully

# 4. Verify results
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE responses::jsonb->>'format_version' = '2.0') as v2_count,
    COUNT(*) as total
  FROM questionnaire_responses;
"
```

### Step 4: Post-Migration Testing

```bash
# 1. Test new questionnaire submission
# - Submit a test questionnaire response
# - Verify it's saved in v2.0 format

# 2. Test schedule generation
# - Generate a test schedule
# - Verify ministers are assigned correctly
# - Check special events work

# 3. Test questionnaire viewing
# - View existing responses
# - Confirm data displays correctly
```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If Migration Fails

```bash
# 1. Restore from automatic backup
BACKUP_FILE="backups/questionnaire_responses_backup_TIMESTAMP.json"

# 2. See server/migrations/README.md for restore instructions

# 3. Review error logs
# 4. Fix issues
# 5. Re-run migration
```

### If Code Issues Found

```bash
# 1. Revert code changes
git revert <commit-hash>

# 2. Redeploy previous version

# 3. Data is safe (migration is idempotent)
```

## Monitoring

### First 24 Hours

Monitor these metrics:

1. **Error Rates**
   - Watch for errors in questionnaire submission
   - Check schedule generation errors
   - Monitor API error logs

2. **Response Format**
   ```sql
   -- Check format distribution
   SELECT
     CASE
       WHEN responses::jsonb->>'format_version' = '2.0' THEN 'v2.0'
       ELSE 'legacy'
     END as format,
     COUNT(*)
   FROM questionnaire_responses
   GROUP BY format;
   ```

3. **User Reports**
   - Watch for user-reported issues
   - Check support tickets
   - Monitor feedback channels

### First Week

1. **Data Quality**
   - Verify all new submissions use v2.0
   - Check data integrity
   - Confirm no data loss

2. **Performance**
   - Monitor query performance
   - Check schedule generation times
   - Verify no performance degradation

3. **Functionality**
   - Confirm all features working
   - Test edge cases
   - Verify special events

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Migration Complete**
- All responses converted to v2.0 format
- No errors during migration
- Backup created successfully

âœ… **Functionality Working**
- New submissions use v2.0 format
- Schedule generation works correctly
- Special events handled properly
- Users can view/edit responses

âœ… **No Regressions**
- No increase in error rates
- No performance degradation
- No user complaints
- All tests passing

---

## Timeline

### Recommended Schedule

**Day 1 (Deployment Day)**
- âœ… Deploy code changes
- âœ… Run migration
- âœ… Verify success
- âœ… Monitor for issues

**Day 2-3 (Initial Monitoring)**
- Monitor error rates
- Check user feedback
- Verify new submissions

**Day 7 (Week Review)**
- Review metrics
- Confirm stability
- Delete backup (if all good)

**Day 30 (Month Review)**
- Final verification
- Mark migration complete
- Document lessons learned

---

## Communication

### Internal Team

**Before Deployment:**
> We're deploying the questionnaire standardization update. This will:
> - Standardize all response formats
> - Run a migration on existing data
> - Improve data consistency
>
> Expected downtime: None (migration runs live)
> Expected duration: ~15 seconds for 100 responses

**After Deployment:**
> âœ… Questionnaire standardization deployed successfully
> - Migration completed: [X] responses processed
> - Format: 100% v2.0
> - Monitoring: All systems normal

### Users (If Needed)

Usually no user communication needed as:
- No downtime
- No UI changes
- No functionality changes
- Transparent to end users

---

## Emergency Contacts

Have these ready during deployment:

- Database admin: [Contact]
- Technical lead: [Contact]
- On-call engineer: [Contact]
- Backup person: [Contact]

---

## Post-Deployment Cleanup

### After 7 Days (If All Good)

```bash
# 1. Delete backup files
rm backups/questionnaire_responses_backup_*.json

# 2. Update documentation
# - Mark migration as complete
# - Update version numbers
# - Archive migration notes

# 3. Close related tickets
```

### After 30 Days

```bash
# Optional: Remove legacy format support
# (Only if absolutely sure everything works)

# 1. Remove extractQuestionnaireData function
# 2. Simplify scheduleGenerator.ts
# 3. Update documentation
```
