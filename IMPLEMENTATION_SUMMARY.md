### 2. Algorithm Specifications (Already in `scheduleGenerator.ts`)

#### Phase 1: Mass Priority Calculation
- ✅ Solemnities: 1.5x priority (Christmas, Easter, St. Jude Oct 28)
- ✅ Sunday 10h & 19h: 1.3x priority (highest attendance)
- ✅ Special masses: 1.2x priority (1st Thu/Fri/Sat)
- ✅ Sunday 8h: 1.0x priority
- ✅ Weekday masses: 0.8x priority

#### Phase 2: Minister Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
calculateScore(minister, mass, position) {
  score = 100

  // Availability (40% weight)
  if (marked available) score += 40
  if (disponível para cobrir) score += 20

  // Fair distribution (30% weight)
  if (assignments < 2) score += 30
  if (assignments >= 4) score -= 30

  // Experience matching (20% weight)
  if (position <= 4 && experience >= 2 years) score += 20
  if (position <= 12 && experience >= 1 year) score += 15
  if (novice && position >= 21) score += 10

  // Saint name bonus (10% weight)
  score += saintNameBonus * 10

  // Penalties
  if (served_last_week) score -= 50
  if (family_member_already_scheduled_this_day) score -= 100

  return Math.max(0, score)
}
```

#### Phase 3: Assignment Logic
- ✅ Sorts minister-position pairs by score
- ✅ Assigns highest scores first
- ✅ Ensures minimum coverage before ideal coverage
- ✅ Tracks assignments per minister for balance
- ✅ Prevents family conflicts on same day

### 3. Frontend Features (`client/src/pages/AutoScheduleGeneration.tsx`)

#### Test Mode UI
- **"Testar Algoritmo (Dados Fictícios)"** button added
- Comprehensive test results display:
  - Statistics grid (Masses, Coverage, Confidence, Fairness)
  - Distribution metrics (ministers used, average assignments, variance)
  - Quality breakdown (high/medium/low confidence schedules)
  - Outliers detection and warning
  - Sample schedules preview
  - Options to regenerate or close results

#### Existing Features
- Month/Year selector with liturgical season awareness
- Generate and Preview buttons
- Statistics dashboard (coverage, unique ministers, confidence, balance)
- Schedule list with minister assignments and positions
- Edit dialog for manual adjustments
- Save functionality with unsaved changes tracking

### 4. Data Integration

#### Sources
- ✅ Liturgical calendar from `/api/liturgical` endpoints
- ✅ Questionnaire responses from database
- ✅ Minister availability and skills
- ✅ Mass configurations from `massConfig.ts`
- ✅ Saint name matching for bonus calculations

#### Mass Configurations
- Regular masses (Sunday 8h/10h/19h, weekday 6:30)
- Special monthly observances (1st Thu/Fri/Sat)
- St. Jude masses (day 28 all months, October feast day)
- St. Jude Novena (Oct 20-27)
- Solemnities (Christmas, Easter, Corpus Christi, etc.)
- Holy Week special masses

### 5. Validation System

#### Pre-Publish Checks
- ✅ All Sunday masses have minimum ministers
- ✅ Special celebrations adequately covered
- ✅ No minister over maximum assignments (default: 4)
- ✅ Distribution variance < 30%

#### Runtime Validations
- Minister availability verification
- Same-day conflict detection
- Family member conflict prevention
- Experience-position matching
- Questionnaire response requirements

### 6. Statistics & Analytics

#### Generated Metrics
- **Coverage**: Percentage of positions filled
- **Fairness**: Inverse of distribution variance
- **Confidence**: Per-mass quality score (0-1)
- **Utilization Rate**: Percentage of ministers used
- **Distribution Variance**: Standard deviation of assignments
- **Special Mass Coverage**: Coverage by mass type
- **Outliers**: Ministers with too many/few assignments

#### Test Results Display
- Total masses generated
- Coverage percentage
- Average confidence score
- Fairness score
- Unique ministers utilized
- Assignment distribution statistics
- Quality breakdown (high/medium/low confidence)
- Outlier detection and warnings
